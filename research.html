					<i>From The Oxide Precursor To The Active Site - Theoretical Investigations Of The Mechanism Of Ethylene Polymerization Over The Phillips Catalyst</i>

					Plastic bags, tubes, storage containers, etc. – many of these items we meet every day. No matter where you are, at school, job, or just go shopping, they all hide somewhere. There is one particular thing that all of these stuffs have in common. Quite often, they are made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the simplest man-made polymer. You might probably have heard about this material because of its bad reputation in terms of low biodegradability, and consequently, significant deposition in the environment. What is really striking is that the mechanism of its formation is still unknown, although its annual industrial production reaches billions of kilograms.
					<br><br>
					The Phillips (CrO<sub>x</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>) catalyst is one of the most efficient system that allows to perform such a transformation. Once contacted with ethylene, yet unknown set of reactions takes place, eventually leading to a long polymer. Many experimental works clearly indicate that the synthetized catalyst really suffers from the lack of electrons, i.e., has more ‘positive charge’. We used to call such a state with the term ‘oxidized’. Oxidized catalyst will eagerly react with something that has some electrons to share, following the famous physical rule of thumb: “positive reacts with negative”. Experimental results do not provide a detail information what is going on here, although almost all of them agree that, eventually, reduced Cr sites are formed. The latter are believed to be responsible for ethylene polymerization. This is the reason why I decided to perform in-depths theoretical calculation in that field. What I found is that the reaction between ethylene and the oxidized catalyst is a 2-step process. It leads to Cr(II) site (fully reduced Cr oxide species on silica) and proceeds with the side formation of formaldehyde (the simplest aldehyde). Formaldehyde can be further oxidized to a gas phase CO/CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.
					<br><br>
					Having proposed the most probable mechanism of reduction, I switched to the polymerization. I calculated many potential pathways assuming various structures of the active sites and their precursors. For the sake of comparison, I also computed the transformations postulated in the literature. The most promising results were obtained for Cr(III)-OH species – the structure never studied before. A reaction pathway involving this species seems to be the most accessible, however, other pathways cannot be precluded because of small differences in the reported values (within an error of the method used). It clearly suggests that further experimental investigations are required. Nevertheless, I also speculated about mechanism of Cr(III)-OH formation from Cr(II), H<sub>2</sub>O and neighboring surface defect. The role of surface defects was also considered directly in the active site formation.
					<br><br>
					In addition to this, I (and my friends of course) developed a series of advanced models of amorphous silica surface that well and accurately describe the properties of the real material. They can be easily applied in the future studies of adsorption or as a support for modelling catalysts.
					<br><br>				
					The efforts undertaken in this project provide unique knowledge about chemical nature of the Phillips CrO<sub>x</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. Although it would be unwise to claim that the mysterious mechanisms were definitively established, the obtained results provide a new view on the field and stimulate further experimental studies. Finally, the obtained results may help to develop more efficient catalyst. Who knows, maybe small improvement in the system can additionally enhance degradability rate or allow us to design catalysts directly for depolymerization.
